# Nashville City Cemetery Analysis

# Intro

Nashville City Cemetery Analysis is an exploratory data analysis project aiming to practice key Excel data manipulation skills. These skills include cleaning data, filtering, sorting, creating pivot tables, and aggregating and summarizing data. The ultimate goal of the project is to create marketing material for the Nashville City Cemetery to increase engagement, based on the findings from the data analysis. The final marketing material is a PDF of a cemetery scavenger hunt, complete with a key and additional information on the back. The scavenger hunt can also be completed digitally via Google Forms.
